Creates a file with 2+ sets of results to compare the scores

```{r}
large <- readr::read_delim("../results/results_large.csv", "\t")
small <- readr::read_delim("../results/results_small.csv", "\t")
standard <- readr::read_delim("../results/results_standard.csv", "\t")

large$score_large <- large$score
large$score <- NULL

small$score_small <- small$score
small$score <- NULL

standard$score_standard <- standard$score
standard$score <- NULL

comparison <- dplyr::inner_join(small, standard, 
                                by=c(type_2="type_2", type_1="type_1", by="by", n="n"))
comparison <- dplyr::inner_join(comparison, large,  
                                by=c(type_2="type_2", type_1="type_1", by="by", n="n"))

#comparison$compare <- comparison$score_standard - comparison$score_smaller

#write.csv(comparison, "../results/comparison_small_large_mfcc.csv")
```

Note: I'm not sure what changing the window length during the features extraction does, but it returns different scores. `comparison$compare` shows the results of `score_standard - score_smaller`.
