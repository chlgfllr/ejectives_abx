Used the `Sound > Query > Get value at time...` function in Praat to extract amplitude estimates every 0.005 seconds (inverse de 200 Hz, might have to change this value). 

```{r}
egg <- readr::read_delim("../results/egg_fixed/egg.csv", " ")
egg$X27 <- NULL

item <- readr::read_delim("../results/fixed/abx.item", " ")

info <- dplyr::select(item, `#file`, onset, offset, `#item`, sequence, syllables, 
                      type, place, vowel, position, speaker, question, new)
egg_ <- dplyr::inner_join(info, egg, by=c(`#file`="#file"))

write.csv(egg_, "../results/egg_fixed/egg_edit.csv", quote = F, row.names = F)
```
